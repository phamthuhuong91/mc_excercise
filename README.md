# mc_excercise

How could these problems have been prevented?
Review the workflow on Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice and try to identify all of the individual things that they did wrong AND all of the things that they should have done but failed to do. Write up descriptions of those things and put those into the README of the repo.

Having a branch for each feature.

Do a pull request before creating new branch.

Bob and Carol did not checkout from main before creating a new branch. Then the Bob Carol team and Ted Alice team work on the same file. Then try to merge back to main. Both team should have checked if there is a new change.

When working in team, do small little commit all the time, not the huge (~hours work) one.
